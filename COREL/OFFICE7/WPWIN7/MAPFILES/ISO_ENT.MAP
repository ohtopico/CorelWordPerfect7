    (C) 1996 Corel Corporation Limited.  All Rights Reserved.

    This external entity mapping file can be used when incorporating
    ISO 8879 character entity sets in your DTD.  Each set is mapped
    to a file containing the matching SGML entity declarations from
    Annex D of ISO 8879.
    
    When the resulting LGC file is loaded into WordPerfect for Windows 7
    by selecting an appropriate SGML Document Type, the entities from each
    referenced set are added to the SDATA list in the "Text References"
    dialog.

    File:  WP_WPC.MAP     (External Entity Mapping File)
    (C) 1996 Corel Corporation Limited.  All Rights Reserved.

    This external entity mapping file can be used to add support for WP
    extended character entity sets in your DTD.  Each WP character set
    (1-11, 13-14) has a matching character mapping file that maps each
    character in the set to a unique entity name.
    
    The SGML "mode" of WordPerfect for Windows 7 treats an extended character
    mapped in this manner as an implicit text (entity) reference.  When a
    file is saved in SGML format these extended characters are translated
    into standard SGML entity references.  When an SGML file is retrieved
    using File:Open each reference to an entity mapped in this manner is
    converted to its matching WP extended character.

    File:  ISO_WPC.MAP     (External Entity Mapping File)
    (C) 1996 Corel Corporation Limited.  All Rights Reserved.

    This external entity mapping file can be used when incorporating ISO
    8879 character entity sets in your DTD.  Each set has a matching
    character mapping file that maps as many as possible of the ISO 8879
    entities to WordPerfect extended characters.
    
    The SGML "mode" of WordPerfect for Windows 7 treats an extended character
    mapped in this manner as an implicit text (entity) reference.  When a
    file is saved in SGML format these extended characters are translated
    into standard SGML entity references.  When an SGML file is retrieved
    using File:Open each reference to an entity mapped in this manner is
    converted to its matching WP extended character.

    The members of each referenced set that do not map to a WordPerfect
    6.X extended character will be added to the SDATA list in the "Text
    References" dialog.

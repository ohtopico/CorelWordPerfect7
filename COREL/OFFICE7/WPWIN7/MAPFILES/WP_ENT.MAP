    File:  WP_ENT.MAP     (External Entity Mapping File)
    (C) 1996 Corel Corporation Limited.  All Rights Reserved.

    This external entity mapping file can be used to add support for WP
    extended character entity sets in your DTD.  Each WP character set
    (1-11, 12-14) is mapped to a file containing an SGML entity declaration
    for each character in the set.
    
    When the resulting LGC file is loaded into WordPerfect for Windows 7
    by selecting an appropriate SGML Document Type, the entities from each
    referenced set are added to the SDATA list in the "Text References"
    dialog.

                         cs     NMTOKENS           "A bl"
          --Valid NMTOKENS are single (s), double (d), triple (t), dash (da),
          dot, bold (b), blank (bl), and none (n); they indicate separator
          style. Specify up to F+1 style tokens, where F is the number of
          columns, each preceded by a column number from 0 through F. 0
          applies to separatorbefore 1st column, and 1 through F to separators
          after corresponding columns; unspecified separators are blank.
          Special column "numbers" F (for final) and A (for all others) can
          be used.
          Examples:
              "O d F d" gives double rules as the vertical borders.
              "1 b" gives bold rule after the first column.--

          horizontal borders.--

          columns, to indicate alignment of cells within the corresponding
          column. Alignments are: l(eft), c(enter), r(ight), e(xponent),
          d(ecimal point), and en (en dash). Default is "c" alignment for any
          unspecified column. Tokens are paired with column numbers as with cs.
          Examples:
              "1 l A r" gives left aligned 1st column, all others right.
              "1 l" gives left aligned 1st column, all others center.-->

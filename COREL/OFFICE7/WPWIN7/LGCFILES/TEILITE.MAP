    File:  TEILITE.MAP     (External Entity Mapping File)
    (C) 1996 Corel Corporation Limited.  All Rights Reserved.

    This .MAP file enables special SGML characters to be manipulated as
    WordPerfect extended characters.  For example, to place an "A acute"
    in a document, use WordPerfect's Ctrl-W dialog to insert character
    1,26 (number 26 in the Multinational set).

    If you would rather use entity references to represent special SGML
    characters, make the following changes and recompile TEILITE.DTD
    using the "DTD to LGC" utility:

       1.  Change each occurrence of "WPCHARS" below to "ENTITIES"
       2.  Change each ".wpc" filename extension below to ".ent"
       3.  Save the modified .MAP file.
       4.  Specify the modified .MAP file as the "Entity Mapping File"
           in the "DTD to LGC" dialog.

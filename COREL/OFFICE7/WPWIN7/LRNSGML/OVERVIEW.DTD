<!-- WordPerfect for Windows 7 does not require a <!DOCTYPE... declaration -->

<!-- Simple DTD for illustrating attributes and external entities.
     Illustrates parameter entity declarations for ISO character entity
     sets.  Requires an "external entity mapping file" (ISO_ENT.MAP or
     ISO_WPC.MAP) because it contains references to external entities.

     This DTD has been precompiled into an LGC file, with some layout
     design files prepared.  The OVERVIEW.LGC, OVERVIEW.LSI, OVERVW2.LSI,
     OVERVIEW.LNM and the OVERVIEW.SGM file can be used as a simple example
     of how to use the SGML features of WordPerfect for Windows 7.

     If you compile this DTD using ISO_WPC.MAP as the "entity mapping file",
     the entities declared in the following public ISO character sets
     will be mapped to the appropriate WordPerfect extended characters.
     These characters will appear in RED in WordPerfect's Ctrl-W dialog.

<!-- When the "DTD to LGC" utility is parsing this DTD and encounters the

     mapping files.

<!-- To keep the size of this sample LGC file small we have commented out

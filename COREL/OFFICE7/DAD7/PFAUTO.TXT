Programmer's Reference for PFAUTO.DLL
Rev. June 28, 1996
=================================================================

PFAUTO.DLL contains an OLE Automation interface to control the
PerfectScript macro system found in PerfectFit shared code and
used by Corel Corporation Limited in the Corel WordPerfect, Corel
Presentations, and Corel Quattro Pro products.  The interface is
made up of several properties and the methods that act on those
properties.  These allow the user to control the playing and
recording of PerfectScript macros and to set and get variables
from the PerfectScript persistent variable pool.

OLE Automation Object Name
==========================
The OLE Automation object name is "PerfectFit.PerfectScript" and
would be used in an automation controller as follows (NOTE:  all
examples are given in Visual Basic code syntax):

Private Sub MySub()
     Dim objPF as Object

     Set objPF = CreateObject("Perfectfit.PerfectScript")

     objPF.Property...
     objPF.Method...
     etc.
End Sub

Object Properties
=================
Each of the object properties can be set and retrieved via OLE
Automation.  For example, to set the value of the ScriptName
property, then later in the code output that to a text box, the
code would be:

objPF.ScriptName = "c:\temp\testme.wcm"
more code here...
Text1.Text = objPF.ScriptName

The properties are shown below.

ScriptName
----------
The ScriptName property specifies the path and filename to a
PerfectScript script if playing or recording a file script, or to
a script template name if playing or recording a script into a
Corel WordPerfect template file.

TemplateName
------------
The TemplateName property specifies the path and filename to a
Corel WordPerfect template if playing or recording a script into
a Corel WordPerfect template file.

VariableName
------------
The VariableName property is set to the name of a PerfectScript
persistent variable.  A PerfectScript persistent variable remains
in scope as long as the PerfectFit system is active, such as when
Corel WordPerfect is being used.  Persistent variables remain in
scope even between the playing of separate scripts.

Script Object Methods
---------------------
The scriptint methods of the PerfectFit.PerfectScript object
carry out actions in the PerfectScript system based on the
properties set at the time the method is invoked.  All of the
methods take no parameters and return a boolean value True or
False indicating the result of the method.  The following methods
are available.

     BOOL ScriptPlay()
     The ScriptPlay method will play a file script if the
     ScriptName property is a valid PerfectScript script file.

     BOOL TemplateScriptPlay()
     The TemplateScriptPlay method will play a valid
     PerfectScript script named in the ScriptName property in the
     Corel WordPerfect template found in the TemplateName
     property.

     BOOL ScriptRecord()
     The ScriptRecord method begins a PerfectScript recording
     session and records the script to the filename specified in
     the ScriptName property.  Template scripts cannot be
     recorded.

     BOOL PauseScriptRecord()
     The PauseScriptRecord method pauses the current recording
     session started by the ScriptRecord method.

     BOOL ResumeScriptRecord ()
     The ResumeScriptRecord method will restart a script
     recording session paused by the PauseScriptRecord method.

     BOOL StopScriptRecord()
     StopScriptRecord terminates a script recording session that
     was started using ScriptRecord().

Persistent Variable Methods
---------------------------
The persistent variable methods let the programmer set, change,
or discard PerfectScript persistent variables.  The methods are
explained below.

     BOOL SetPerfectScriptVariable(VariableValue)
     This method will create a persistent variable in the
     PerfectScript system with the name indicated in the
     VariableName property and with the value passed in the
     VariableValue parameter.

     BOOL PerfectScriptVariableExists()
     This method returns true if the variable contained in the
     VariableName property exists in the PerfectScript system, or
     false if it does not.

     VariableValue  GetPerfectScriptVariable()
     This method returns the value of the variable named in the
     VariableName property.  If the variable does not exist, this
     will return an empty variant to the controller.

     BOOL DiscardPerfectScriptVariable()
     This method will discard the PerfectScript variable named in
     the VariableName property.  The variables will remain in
     memory until this method is used or until the PerfectFit
     session is closed.
